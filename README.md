# Scrapy Parser

This project demonstrates the power of [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) for web scraping and automation. The Scrapy Parser efficiently collects data from websites and structures it for further analysis or storage.

## Features

- **Customizable Crawling**: Easily define target websites and pages to scrape.
- **Flexible Data Output**: Export scraped data to formats like JSON or CSV.
- **Efficient Web Scraping**: Handles web scraping tasks with optimized requests and responses.
- **Configurable Settings**: Modify user agent, delays, and other configurations to prevent bans.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smoky333/scrapy_parser.git
cd scrapy_parser
2. Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
1. Define Target URLs
Open the spider file (e.g., spiders/example_spider.py) and set the target URLs in the start_urls list:

python
start_urls = [
    'https://example.com/page1',
    'https://example.com/page2',
]
2. Run the Scraper
Execute the following command to start scraping:

bash
scrapy crawl your_spider_name
3. Save the Data
Export the scraped data to a file:

JSON:
bash
scrapy crawl your_spider_name -o output.json
CSV:
bash
scrapy crawl your_spider_name -o output.csv
Configuration
User Agent
Update the USER_AGENT setting in settings.py to mimic a browser and avoid detection:

python
USER_AGENT = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36'
Download Delay
Set a delay between requests to prevent being flagged as a bot:

python
DOWNLOAD_DELAY = 2  # Delay in seconds
